<p>Define strengths/experience and roles early and openly (be open enough that everyone knows their role and others&#39; roles and they will stick to these roles)</p>
<p>The person with the best/most experience should have a slight leadership/coordination role while being open to everyone&#39;s additions</p>
<p>Have the format of things clearly and visually defined</p>
<p>Make sure the people actually have compatible and complementary skills (for example, the person who is doing the design should be comfortable with the person doing the business side, and they should respect each other&#39;s roles and opinions)</p>
<p>Good communications is super important, and sometimes it&#39;s an inherent thing (first languages, personalities) as much as it is a matter of effort and practice</p>
<p>If you&#39;re going to make the initiative and do something, you better have a clear idea of what you&#39;re doing and lead all the way and push the project forward; otherwise people will be left sitting wondering what&#39;s happening
If you do feel like you want to give up the lead, give it up clearly and have someone else take creative direction of the project</p>
<p>Hardest part is figuring WHAT you need to be doing. No one likes to think about this. That&#39;s why people like to look up to a leader - so they don&#39;t have to carry the responsibility of figuring out what to do. That means that there should be a leader. </p>
<p>Honest, continuous feedback would be very helpful. Just have everyone submit anonymously how they feel after every meeting. If it&#39;s bad, ask how it can become more clear, effective.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t micromanage. If you want someone to do design, then you can&#39;t direct how you want each detail to be. You have to trust that they do their part.</p>
<p>It sucks when you don&#39;t trust your group lead / manager, when they haven&#39;t proven their ability to you. 
Team members really need to trust the group lead / manager to do good work.</p>
<p>Never say the terms &#39;creative&#39; or &#39;innovative&#39;</p>
<p>You can&#39;t just assign people work after you&#39;ve figured everything out in your head. You can&#39;t just let people fill in the blanks. We&#39;re not in school anymore. We all care about the work we do.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the kind of person you want.
Someone who can do something other people can&#39;t do, and output great work that you don&#39;t have to fix.</p>

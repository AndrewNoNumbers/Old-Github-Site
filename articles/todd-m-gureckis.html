<p>Todd M. Gureckis
NYU</p>
<p>B.S. in EE/CE</p>
<p>Cross-section of computation (autonomous, self-learning artificial systems) and education (<em>self-directed learning</em>, autodidactic study, adaptive teaching)</p>
<h2>How are information selection decisions made?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Positive Testing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Label Entropy (predictive uncertainty)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Information Gain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After doing a bunch of checks to make sure participants understood the rules, still got the same result, so we think it&#39;s a robust result</p>
<p>Most people use Label Entropy model (predictive uncertainty)</p>
<p>So in self-directed learning, most use predictive uncertainty rather than positive testing or information gain </p>
<p>Can design experiment so that positive testing creates negative, or creates neutral result</p>
<p>Does time pressure influence people toward PTS instead of IG (because IG requires more time)?
Yes, it does</p>
<p><em>this was one research paper</em></p>
<p>Former grad student: Doug Markant</p>
<h2>Effects of self-directed learning on simple concept formation</h2>
<p><em>Yoked learning experiments</em>
Self-directed learner vs. yoked learner (gets the same information that the SDL chose but without having the choice)</p>
<p>these are extremely tight, all based on simulated data; is this a cog sci thing? probably
Cog sci is a very, very tight and dry thing (not at all connected to society)</p>
<p>Being yoked, even to a good SDL, actually makes you perform worse</p>
<p>How do we explain this?
Hypothesis-dependent sampling bias?
The data you choose to test your hypothesis must be good for <em>your</em> initial hypothesis, and a yoked learner&#39;s hypothesis can be different than the SDL&#39;s hypothesis</p>
<p>The more strategic the SDL is in testing hypothesis, the bigger the gap to the yoked learner</p>
<p><em>interesting paper, can look more into this</em></p>
<h2>Effects of self-directed learning on memory</h2>
<p>Grad student: Sarah Dubrow</p>
<p>People who had volitional control over unveiling images had better image recognition, spatial recall,  and greater overall brain activity in fRMI
Volitional control lets one learn according to the rate he/she is able to take in the information</p>
<p>There are benefits to volitional control in all variations of the experiments
Surprisingly minimal conditions of self-directed control still positively influence memory (controlling the timing and flow of information helps)</p>
<p>Active learning literature</p>
<p>Own experience teaching flipped classroom shows that too, that learning is better</p>
<p>The computer really lets you do a lot more interesting experiments</p>
<hr>
<p>All academia, that I&#39;ve been interested in anyway, is based on scientific method</p>
<p>Professors care about their research, not so much about teaching.
Academia is useful, but very specific and low in influence
It is completely about cognitive science, not about society or how it plays in society</p>
<p>the experiment experience is quite dry and questionable though </p>
<p>these academic presentations are actually far beyond an undergrad&#39;s level</p>

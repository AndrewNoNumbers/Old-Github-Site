<p>Bob Shanks</p>
<p>For every job an automaker puts in, there are 10 jobs that are created as a direct result of that (in suppliers, dealers, etc.)</p>
<p>For a big corporation like Ford that does business in many countries, all the little geopolitical issues matter
Consumer wants are changing</p>
<p>Disruption is quite clearly knocking at our doors</p>
<p>Ford has grown from 1 million units a year in China to 20+ million a year</p>
<p>Disruption:
- potentially new OEMs (Apple?, Google?) - barriers to entry in this industry are lower than they were
- autonomous vehicles and connectivity
- customer experience (like Tesla completely changes the customer experience, resulting in huge customer satisfaction rate)
- carsharing
- cities that restrict car sales</p>
<p>Mine:
What a vehicle/car is
Ownership</p>
<p>&quot;So disruptive we can&#39;t even begin to think of what it means&quot;
&quot;very frightening, but that&#39;s not how we think about it&quot;
&quot;what&#39;s part of our business, what&#39;s part of another&#39;s business&quot;</p>
<p>Consumer experience is something Ford wants to lead in
They really admire Tesla, not even so much for their product, but for their customer experience</p>
<p>Trying to bring Lincoln into China, starting this past November, focusing on a good customer experience</p>
<p>Mobility:
how people use their cars, how cars fit into their lives, how it fits into the overall transportation ecosystem - how Ford fits into that</p>
<p>Has acknowledged climate change is happening, and sustainability report guides the company in doing a part </p>
<p>Asia-Pacific is one of their reporting regions</p>
<p>Did a major restructuring of business leading up to 2005, because business was very broken
Had to basically reinvent the business
Did it actually just in time before the economic downturn</p>
<p>Vision:
People working together as a lean global enterprise
Wants to be more balanced in where they make their money, since SUVs and trucks creates a lot of their profit right now
Wants to target operating margins of around 8-9% (Toyota, Hyundai/Kia, VW are the only other companies that can achieve these right now)</p>
<p>Just opened new innovation center in Palo Alto (ramping up from current 25 people to 120 people)</p>

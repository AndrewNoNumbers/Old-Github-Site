<h3>Ron Conway</h3>
<p>Having Alexis Ohanian on the board would really help  - ala Product Hunt</p>
<p>You have to be ambitious and tough
You can&#39;t <em>learn</em> to be ambitious and driven</p>
<p>How to hire a management team, how to spread your vision, how to make them as motivated as you
These are things you learn</p>
<p><strong>You have to make everyone else as interested in the idea as you are </strong></p>
<p>Ron Conway, 20 years of angel investing
13 person team at SV Angels does all the due diligence
Need to bring in people in their 20s (because they know how to look at things from a youth perspective)</p>
<p>When meeting, watch the interaction between the cofounders
**One person finds the need, but the cofounders come up with the idea together</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cofounder should be 90% as excited and inspired on the idea
You talk to the other person about the need, and they really want to work on it**</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pinterest and Ben Silverman took forever to get funded
It was his rifle focus on the product that carried them through</p>
<p>The idea is not the investor&#39;s job, it&#39;s the team they need to account for
Drew Houston had great team, but Ron Conway was negative about the idea and thus missed out on the investment</p>
<p>Focus shirt</p>
<p>You will keep tweaking the product until user growth explodes</p>
<p>When you admit something&#39;s not working and everyone knows it, morale goes up because everyone&#39;s in it together</p>
<h3>Indiegogo</h3>
<p>Clearly built a story (TED talk-like) around the idea
It&#39;s not a paradigm-shifting idea, but you can craft a long story around it to show it&#39;s paradigm-shifting
Founder went back to Berkeley business school, had idea of how to &quot;democratize access to capital&quot;</p>
<p>Your &quot;why&quot; finds you your partners</p>
<p>Finally raised seed after 3 years </p>
<p><strong>Your &quot;why&quot; attracts amazing people</strong></p>
<p>Culture first
Know your values, screen everyone you hire for it
Gives out &quot;iggies&quot; for acts that are aligned with company value</p>
<p>eNPS
OKR grades</p>
<p>What if we built something like Indiegogo
It&#39;s a simple, but possibly world-changing idea</p>
<h3>Kevin Systrom Instagram</h3>
<p>Tech childhood</p>
<p>Went to Stanford because people like to work hard on things but also enjoy life</p>
<p>You don&#39;t have to the best, but just enough to be dangerous
So you can build something out, but find other people who are much better than you who can take over the technical parts</p>
<p>Treelist
Was in Florence and didn&#39;t have internet or much else to do so built the site on his iBook
Being on the other side of the world, all he had were metrics, not the reaction from friends and other students</p>
<p>Took photography class in Florence and used Holga</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Bias toward action&quot;</strong>
Marines
<strong>What is the appropriate action you can take with the amount of risk and amount of information you have?
There is no perfect next move</strong>
By learning and moving, that&#39;s how you progress</p>
<p>Left Marketing at Google, joined another startup, and then started Burbn/Instagram</p>
<p><strong>Take new technologies and hot trends and swap them around</strong></p>
<p>Added filters to Instagram after girlfriend realized people who took interesting photographs used Hipstamatic</p>
<p>The Valley is really small
you&#39;ll meet the same people in one job and another</p>
<p>Talked to person at NYT and got them to write about it
<strong>You have to be your own advocate, because no one else has a stake in it</strong></p>
<p>Launched it on App Store (this was pretty early when the first iPhone was around iOS 3?)
Launched on one server (there was no distributed cloud)</p>
<p><strong>Were really lucky, being in the right place at the right time, with the right team</strong></p>
<p><strong>A community is hard to build; anyone can build a product</strong></p>
<h3>Reid Hoffman and Sam Altman</h3>
<p>Had LinkedIn idea while working at PayPal</p>
<p>How do you get the first million people, because otherwise you don&#39;t get the hundreds of millions of people that follow</p>
<p>Address book found other people, and <strong>then new users felt like they belonged there, and then they added some other people to join them</strong></p>
<p>Downturns are where a lot of great companies are started, because they are able to aggregate a lot of talent and push through</p>
<p>If my confidence is not going up every day, every week, in what we&#39;re doing, what can I do to change</p>
<p>Companies with huge Series A&#39;s almost always don&#39;t turn out well</p>
<p>LinkedIn&#39;s Series B deck </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do I invest in: Networks and marketplaces, because there&#39;s still a lot of room
Marketplace can have great lock-in effect, because this is where the value is for me to do this (says the user)</p>
<p>How do I invest:
Is this how the world should be?
Is the initial plan a good shot at changing how it works?
Is the team and cofounders good for doing this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook was in Boston
Then came here and rented a house</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that your identity and network was going to be a platform for apps and ads, that was something sure to happen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg thinks a lot about making the world more open and transparent, and fast sharing of information. He doesn&#39;t think a lot about games. </p>
<p>The government is in fact what creates the platform environment we operate in. So instead of shunning and running around the government, how do we make government better?</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurship is much better where there are dense networks</strong> </p>
<h3>WhatsApp and Sequoia board member</h3>
<p>Yahoo experience in how to scale infra and the network of people was useful</p>
<p>WhatsApp was based in Mountain View
Sequoia had to find WhatsApp, because they were so covert</p>
<p>$1 to download app, except during some promotions when they would get an influx of users
Wanted to stay under the radar</p>
<p>Was anti-Valley in a lot of ways, in the way the organization was structured</p>
<p>Why was it written in Erlang?</p>
<p>Didn&#39;t have anyone in marketing and finance roles for a long time</p>
<h3>Pebble</h3>
<p>Was in YC S11 working on Impulse watch</p>
<p>later made a successful Kickstsrter project that launched Pebble</p>
<p>UWaterloo student
studied industrial design during study abroad
<strong>Unlike engineers, industrial designers were always sketching</strong></p>
<p>Built prototype using old Nokia screen
purpose was to be able to check phone messages and notifications while biking</p>
<p>Did pitch competitions and won those big checks</p>
<p>Worked with industrial designer to make the initial electrical engineer prototype into something better</p>
<p>Being an engineer-minded person helps people&#39;s bias
You can be a little weird</p>
<p>Leaked it to media and got a lot of excitement</p>
<p>Just brought in Pebble watches to CES</p>
<p>Built the first 500 watches by hand. </p>
<p>Early buyers had amazingly high engagement. People even emailed in good feedback about the watch. </p>
<p>Spent about 2 weeks developing an SDK. </p>
<p>inPulse became Pebble when iOS 5 came out and allowed Bluetooth communication in the background. </p>
<p><strong>Spent months talking to investors but couldn&#39;t get anyone to sign</strong></p>
<p><em>*Investors said: Could you sell software instead? Probably won&#39;t be able to raise money for that product</em></p>
<p>Instead, launched on Kickstarter
Blew through funding goal within 2 hours 
Raised far above that after 30 days</p>
<p>Team had never made a consumer electronics device before
They flew to China and worked with factory to figure out how to make it
Had to ship 85,000 watches</p>
<p>We&#39;re going in a slightly different but very important direction</p>
<p>Wants to be a growing platform other people can hack on</p>
<h3>YC Office Hours (this is pretty good, very fast-paced)</h3>
<p>Group office hours 
batch companies come together and discuss problems</p>
<p>Individual office hours</p>
<p>Company office hours
Companies like AWS or Motorola come in and help</p>
<p>Investor office hours
VCs like Sequoia come in </p>
<p>Your metrics are the heart of your company</p>
<p>Otherwise you can&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p>Don&#39;t repeat yourself - everything you&#39;ve talked about during office hours, you better have tried to solve it for the next week </p>
<h3>Live ohours</h3>
<h4>Divide.io</h4>
<p>Public beta, launched on Monday
Open source Parse</p>
<p>There are other open source products that have become commercial businesses
Like Redhat or MongoDB</p>
<p>Only Android SDK right now
Eventually may do some kind of hosted solution</p>
<p>Has 12 beta testers in group
Already changed licensing from GPL</p>
<p><strong>You should really push on the support-as-a-business model, even at the beginning, to see if there are people willing to pay for it</strong></p>
<h4>Kuona</h4>
<p>Gets prices and deals and indoor location of your shopping list</p>
<p>11,000 users - (interested more in acceleration than the current userbase)
Active in Monterey Mexico</p>
<p>(Where are users hearing about this app?)
How much do you spend on acquisition  </p>
<p>Confident yes</p>
<p>What about the other 65% who don&#39;t use your app. Why?</p>
<p>What are your biggest problems right now?</p>
<p>What are the mechanics of growth? How are people hearing about your app? This is the biggest problem right now. 
How do I think of Kuona?</p>
<p>$0.10-$0.40 cost of acquiring each user, 35% active 
<strong>Paid acquisition should be when everything else already works
So it&#39;s more of just throwing gasoline at the fire</strong></p>
<h4>UtilityAPI</h4>
<p>works with utilities and solar companies</p>
<p>UI feedback, we do this quite frequently
Within milliseconds you should understand what the product does, what customers you&#39;re doing</p>
<p>They just want to know what you do
<strong>Use cases (the customer can then identify with someone they&#39;re like and know they&#39;re supposed to be there)</strong></p>
<p>Why it would be appropriate for me. </p>
<p>If you&#39;re an API company, the docs should be as front and center as possible</p>
<h3>Andrew Mason and Jessica Livingston</h3>
<p>Was a developer before doing UChicago grad school for public policy</p>
<p>Original concept floundered for about a year before become Groupon</p>
<p>Had a hard time getting rest of the team excited about a daily deal site
Knew enough to code a template for Wordpress, so he just set up a Wordpress site</p>
<p><strong>Scaled up so fast in employees there weren&#39;t really the tendons holding people together
There weren&#39;t intrinsic values that people just believed in</strong></p>
<p>Clearly savvy </p>
<p>When you&#39;re public:
The incentives to think short-term, to think quarterly are way too strong</p>
<p>Detour
Audio tours while walking around, it could be pretty cool</p>
<h3>Cloudflare</h3>
<p>2 million customers around the world (incl. YC)
Protects against DDOS attacks
Makes websites faster</p>
<p>120 employees in SF and London
3,000 new sign-ups every day</p>
<p>Three of them started Cloudflare
Lee Holloway tech person </p>
<p>Eventually you have to ship product, even if it&#39;s cringe-worthy. </p>
<p>For months they tried to get to 100 customers and it was hard</p>
<p>Picking up donated servers from people gave them an opportunity to talk about what they&#39;re building and whether they would use it</p>
<p>None of the 3 of them ever fought about who should do what, it was always very natural</p>
<p>Do you cover a lot of surface area as you and your cofounders?</p>
<p>Then we hired other people to fill in the little areas we weren&#39;t covering</p>
<p>Just have a team that can build things scrappily that people can use</p>
<p>Michelle has ego but no vanity
It&#39;s about the company first, not about putting me on the cover of a magazine</p>
<p>Web infrastructure company </p>
<p>When you know a lot about an industry sometimes you don&#39;t check your assumptions enough 
If you&#39;re not an expert in it you are at an advantage </p>
<p>5% of web traffic goes through us
Huge organizations depend on us
It&#39;s incredibly stressful
But at least we matter</p>
<p>Litmus test for board members:
If the worst case scenario happens, would we have any hesitation about calling this person?</p>
<h3>Jawbone - Houssain and Jessica Livingston</h3>
<p>American company in consumer electronics
Great design and brand</p>
<p>Started in 1990&#39;s</p>
<p>Got a government grant from DARPA </p>
<p>Crazy time at Stanford
Larry and Sergey, Marissa Mayer etc. </p>
<p>Wanted to license their noise cancellation technology to others
Like Dolby Sound or Intel Inside</p>
<p>There were very few venture-funded consumer electronics companies</p>
<p>First product Jawbone launched was a stillborn
Company was shut down</p>
<p>Then built it from a clean state again and launched first Bluetooth headset</p>
<p>Company was still very small at that time</p>
<p>Then Silicon Valley VCs came in and gave them funding</p>
<p>Launched Jawbone Up which sold extremely well but had hardware issue</p>
<p>Everything in the past 14 years has been in preparation for now and what we&#39;re doing thing hardware and software and data together </p>
<p>It&#39;s a lot more friendly now then it used to be</p>
<p>There&#39;s okay industrial design and then there&#39;s actually good industrial design by someone who knows what it means (like Jawbone&#39;s or Apple&#39;s products)</p>
<h3>Twitch and Justin.tv</h3>
<p>First class at YC</p>
<p>All I had were a desire to make it happen and a network of people who support you </p>
<p>Built and launched no less than 6 ideas in a year and a half. 
Became much better programmers </p>
<p>Brought Michael Sybal on as CEO to keep us from meandering to something else</p>
<p>Then shifted Justin.tv into a platform
How do we repurpose this?</p>
<p>Didn&#39;t know why they were growing and why they flatlined</p>
<p>Then did Socialcam and Twitch, which became two branches</p>
<p>Socialcam got spun off</p>
<p>Twitch was finally when he could put together all of his past experience trying to run a company and put together something </p>
<p>Twitch launched after about 9 months of work</p>
<p>Don&#39;t do business development deals until you have a product that&#39;s taking off </p>
<p>Eventually it gets better, if you stick with it, even if you have to change your idea</p>
<p>It&#39;s a reflection of you, you have to build the skills</p>

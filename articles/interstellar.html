<blockquote>
<p>Interstellar is probably one of the greatest films I&#39;ve seen in years. It leave you emotionally shattered at the end of it, pushing all the right buttons relentlessly for nearly 3 hours - tears, funny, tension (some really tense moments), and then towards the end, pushing the intelligence of the audience to the very edge, beyond what we know, to what may be possible.</p>
<p>The movie was grand in scale as well as in attention to detail. It stayed cohesive even as it spread out to mind numbing extension and expansion and yet somehow it managed to retain a connection with the raw human emotions that we all share through the fact of our existence. The ending was as thought provoking as it was emotionally explosive-a true masterpiece and one of the best films i&#39;ve seen in years. Do not be swayed by small minds.</p>
<p>Really, because I read this review and wondered if The New Republic had become some idiocy-spewing conservative garbage. </p>
<p>What&#39;s remarkable is that the film can be interpreted both ways, and so any criticism at the film can also be interpreted in either political direction. </p>

<h2>A bit of history</h2>
<p>4 co-founders </p>
<p>All went to high school together<br>went to different colleges<br>got together at Berkeley, raised some funding  </p>
<p>hadn&#39;t had any real world jobs at the time</p>
<p>Two co-founders were on the tech side
was in meetings all day, even as VP of Engineering<br>made the hard decision to give up role and go back to focusing on engineering</p>
<p>In a startup, there&#39;s tech ops, and there&#39;s engineering</p>
<p>spending a year at a real company is really valuable</p>
<p>dropped out sophomore year</p>
<h2>On managing</h2>
<p>at some point the company becomes a certain size and the work becomes a little more abstracted and you don&#39;t exactly have insight into what every individual contributor is doing<br>you just hire amazing people and trust them to execute</p>
<p>Within engineering: individual contributors and management each has its own ladder, and should go up in compensation equally in a good organization</p>
<h2>How to become a more attractive engineering candidate</h2>
<p>read HN everyday to learn things<br>you&#39;ll learn a shit ton</p>
<p>Github is amazing for watching sw engineers do their work<br>all the most amazing software projects are on Github, and you can contribute very easily</p>
<p>if you&#39;re a contributor on 10 OSS projects, that&#39;s terrific</p>
<p>do hobby projects</p>
<h2>On building Box</h2>
<p>Sam<br>did 2 startups before</p>
<p>Jeff<br>hadn&#39;t done any startups, had a computer consulting business</p>
<p>had an initial angel investor in Seattle</p>
<hr>
<p>What&#39;s good about enterprise<br>They have a lot of users, they have the money, and they have problems to solve</p>
<p>What makes enterprise different<br>CIO has requirements and they need to make sure a tool they use satisfies all that and they need to make sure all 300,000 people in their organization can use this tool effectively</p>
<p>there was a very consumer-focused phase, then focused on enterprise and that was became the revenue source</p>
<hr>
<p>working on this idea all came down to the team<br>wasn&#39;t very optimistic because they couldn&#39;t really figure out a business model</p>
<p>that&#39;s the right way to make a decision all the time, work on something with a group of people you know you&#39;ll have fun with</p>
<p>you should have a broad thesis on the area, but exact implementation can change</p>
<p>It&#39;s a &quot;once-in-a-generation&quot; paradigm shift<br>mainframes -&gt; client-server -&gt; cloud</p>
<p>Box wants to get users now, and that&#39;s what they&#39;re investing in and not turning a profit</p>
<hr>
<p>Aaron got 40,000 sign-ups just by blog marketing<br>was really powerful</p>
<p>sort of pioneered the freemium model<br>didn&#39;t have a revenue model for the first 3 years</p>
<p>4 people<br>vision (that was Aaron), finance, tech, servers</p>
<p>Are we in a tech bubble?<br>A lot of the companies, like Facebook, like Uber create real value and either dominate a market or generate real, meaningful revenue</p>

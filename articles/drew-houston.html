<p>Dropbox was in YC Summer 07 batch<br>And then raised capital from Sequoia</p>
<hr>
<p>2005<br>realized that in school&#39;s network, your drive is always backed up and accessible anywhere on the network, you never have to worry<br>yet you don&#39;t get that once you graduate from school</p>
<p>forgot his flash drive, which had his 3GB Linux VM<br>this was pre-iPhone, so there&#39;s really nothing you can do when you forget to bring something to do on a trip</p>
<p>it&#39;s not &quot;I hate my flash drive&quot; it&#39;s &quot;I hate myself for being so disorganized&quot;</p>
<p>the idea of file sharing has been around forever, why do we still have to deal with this disjointed file storage  </p>
<p>cloud storage was the stereotypical startup idea at the time in the mid-00&#39;s</p>
<hr>
<p>Dropbox loves Python<br>Python for the most part allowed Dropbox to share one codebase on all platforms</p>
<p><strong>&quot;No one is born an entrepreneur&quot;<br>&quot;No one is born with all the answers&quot;  </strong>
There&#39;s no ideal path to becoming a founder</p>
<p>Hiring people is really difficult<br>Public speaking and communicating with people as well</p>
<p>Had an internship in hs<br><strong>Took a year off in college, which was like a bigger dose of what you get in an internship</strong></p>
<p>Worked with some non-technical cofounders<br>Realized there&#39;s more to being valuable than just the technical aspects</p>
<p>Being rush chair in fraternity were some of his first management experience</p>
<p>Work on something that&#39;s so much work you can&#39;t possibly do it on your own</p>
<p><strong>Drew Houston: &quot;How did you learn about all the things you&#39;re working on now?&quot;<br>Elon Musk: &quot;The same way I learned anything else: I read books and I talked to people&quot;<br>If you want to learn something, get the 3 top-rated books on Amazon for said topic; it gives you a sort of framework to work with in understanding how things work </strong></p>
<p>Hack week at Dropbox: the point is so he can spend some time to not take any meetings and not talk to anyone and get back into coding </p>
<p>On the transition from college to working: You get to work on something real and you get paid for it and you get to work with awesome people</p>
<p>College was hardest-working time in life<br>Good thing is you learn to work really hard and really quickly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do the things you won&#39;t be able to do in real life<br>Learn about the things you won&#39;t be able to study outside<br>The 4 years you spend in undergrad, you&#39;re not gonna have that experience again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s way easier to hire people in a downtime</p>
<p><strong>Loved algorithms and distributed systems classes in school</strong> 
Dropbox had lots of technical challenges<br><strong>How Dropbox talks to its servers today is much the same as what Drew Houston built in his apartment</strong></p>
<p><strong>People loved Dropbox and would point out that they loved Dropbox when they saw Drew Houston and his co-founders wearing a Dropbox t-shirt</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s solving a lifetime of pain such as forgetting your thumb drive or losing your files<br>There&#39;s a small secret society of people who know how to make things work in a technology-based world.</p>
<hr>
<p>Pitch to Sequoia:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey, it&#39;s 2007 and we still can&#39;t manage files properly and access them across devices  </li>
<li>Showed them a demo of their working code</li>
<li>An idea of how people will use it and pay for it in the future (sort of a business plan)</li>
<li>Haggled the terms over dinner</li>
<li>At the end of the day, it can be pretty simple if you can get investors excited about something (have a big market, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are indeed wheelbarrows of money here in Silicon Valley, more wheelbarrows of money than there are 22 year-old&#39;s with ideas they want to build.</p>

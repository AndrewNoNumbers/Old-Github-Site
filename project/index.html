Working with a CS friend, we created a tool that predicts the funness of roads by various data fields collected by on-board diagnostics. We presented to a panel of judges, including the head of global marketing at VW Group.</p><h4>How it works</h4><p>The tool pulls in four data fields from VW's OBD-II dataset and calculates it using our funness model, generating an approximate funness rating for each segment of road which, when combined with smartphone GPS data, can be mapped with the Google Maps API.</p><h4>My role</h4><p>Prototyping, UI, web</p></div></section><section class="a-project d"><div class="unit three-of-four"><img src="/img/x.png"/></div><div class="unit one-of-four"><h3>SwapBot</h3><p>I helped plan the user flow and led the design and coding of the website. We won 3rd place and a $500 prize at the Lincoln Labs hackathon in Oct 2013.</p><h4>How it works</h4><p>SwapBot increases clothing donations by creating a better experience for both sides of the system: donors and recipients. We match donors' items to those with a specific need for that item and encourage communications through our platform.</p><h4>My role</h4><p>UX, UI</p></div></section><section class="a-project c"><div class="unit three-of-four"><img src="/img/x.png"/></div><div class="unit one-of-four"><h3>tosigram</h3><p>I conducted user research, interviews, data collection, </p><h4>How it works</h4><p>. </p><h4>My role</h4><p>UX, UI  </p></div></section><section class="a-project b"><div class="unit three-of-four"><img src="/img/Hejia-Composite.png"/></div><div class="unit one-of-four"><h3>Hejia ERP</h3><p>I led a complete redesign of Hejia's mobile ERP client, working with iOS and Android developers to implement on both platforms.</p><h4>How it works</h4><p>Hejia is one of the leading ERP companies in China, providing small and medium-sized businesses with software to manage their businesses.

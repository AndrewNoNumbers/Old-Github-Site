We presented to a panel of judges, including the head of global marketing at VW Group.</p><h4>How it works</h4><p>The tool pulls in four data fields from VW's OBD-II dataset and calculates it using our funness model, generating an approximate funness rating for each segment of road which, when combined with smartphone GPS data, can be mapped with the Google Maps API.</p><h4>My role</h4><p>Prototyping, UI, web</p></div></section><section class="a-project d"><div class="unit three-of-four"><img src="/img/x.png"/></div><div class="unit one-of-four"><h3>SwapBot</h3><p>I helped plan the user flow and led the design and coding of the website.

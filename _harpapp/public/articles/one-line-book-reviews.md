One-line UX book reviews
======================

###Tog on Interface by Bruce Tognazzini (c) 1992
Despite being two decades old, this amazingly entertaining book offers more than historical value as Tog examines many things we seem to have forgotten in designing interfaces (such as how Jungian personality types affect the perception and use of interfaces). 

###Freehand: Sketching Tips and Tricks Drawn From Art by Helen Birch (c) 2013
Handbook of ideas and basics of visual art. Won't make you a better artist but will give you a better grasp of visual art, especially for those without an art background.

###Product Design for the Web: Principles of Designing & Releasing Web Products by Randy J. Hunt, Creative Director, Etsy (c) 2014
Takes the daunting task of defining the entire digital product design field and makes it accessible to a beginner, especially anyone with an arts background but new to product design.

###Usable Usability by Eric Reiss (c) 2012
Practical and accessibly written with rich anecdotes but some inaccuracies. The "10 ways" list at the end of each chapter is helpful. 

###Digital Design Essentials by Raj Lal (c) 2013
100 colorful case studies of questionable taste and usefulness.

###Seductive interaction design creating playful, fun, and effective user experiences by Stephen P. Anderson. 

###Information Architecture: Blueprint for the Web by Christina Wodtke and Austin Govella

Useful alternative to reading the HTML5 spec, with detailed discussion of semantics and how things came to be.

###Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug
A light introduction to thinking about usability.

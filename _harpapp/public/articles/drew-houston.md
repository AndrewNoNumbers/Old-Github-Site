===============================

Dropbox was in YC Summer 07 batch  
And then raised capital from Sequoia

---

2005  
realized that in school's network, your drive is always backed up and accessible anywhere on the network, you never have to worry  
yet you don't get that once you graduate from school

forgot his flash drive, which had his 3GB Linux VM  
this was pre-iPhone, so there's really nothing you can do when you forget to bring something to do on a trip

it's not "I hate my flash drive" it's "I hate myself for being so disorganized"

the idea of file sharing has been around forever, why do we still have to deal with this disjointed file storage  

cloud storage was the stereotypical startup idea at the time in the mid-00's

Dropbox loves Python  
Python for the most part allowed Dropbox to share one codebase on all platforms

**"No one is born an entrepreneur"  
"No one is born with all the answers"  **
There's no ideal path to becoming a founder

Hiring people is really difficult  
Public speaking and communicating with people as well

Had an internship in hs  
**Took a year off in college, which was like a bigger dose of what you get in an internship**

Worked with some non-technical cofounders  
Realized there's more to being valuable than just the technical aspects

Being rush chair in fraternity were some of his first management experience

Work on something that's so much work you can't possibly do it on your own

**Drew Houston: "How did you learn about all the things you're working on now?"  
Elon Musk: "The same way I learned anything else: I read books and I talked to people"  
If you want to learn something, get the 3 top-rated books on Amazon for said topic; it gives you a sort of framework to work with in understanding how things work **

Hack week at Dropbox: the point is so he can spend some time to not take any meetings and not talk to anyone and get back into coding 

On the transition from college to working: You get to work on something real and you get paid for it and you get to work with awesome people

College was hardest-working time in life  
Good thing is you learn to work really hard and really quickly

>Do the things you won't be able to do in real life  
>Learn about the things you won't be able to study outside  
>The 4 years you spend in undergrad, you're not gonna have that experience again

It's way easier to hire people in a downtime

**Loved algorithms and distributed systems classes in school** 
Dropbox had lots of technical challenges  
**How Dropbox talks to its servers today is much the same as what Drew Houston built in his apartment**

**People loved Dropbox and would point out that they loved Dropbox when they saw Drew Houston and his co-founders wearing a Dropbox t-shirt**

It's solving a lifetime of pain such as forgetting your thumb drive or losing your files  
There's a small secret society of people who know how to make things work in a technology-based world.

Pitch to Sequoia:

- Hey, it's 2007 and we still can't manage files properly and access them across devices  
- Showed them a demo of their working code
- An idea of how people will use it and pay for it in the future (sort of a business plan)
- Haggled the terms over dinner
- At the end of the day, it can be pretty simple if you can get investors excited about something (have a big market, etc.)

There are indeed wheelbarrows of money here in Silicon Valley, more wheelbarrows of money than there are 22 year-old's with ideas they want to build.

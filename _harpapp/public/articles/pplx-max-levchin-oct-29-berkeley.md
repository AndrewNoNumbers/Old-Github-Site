U of I was sink or swim, very motivating experience
was proficient coder, but didn't know too much theoretical CS


Most commodities run out  
Data is a commodity that will never run out

Is the person trustworthy, do we as a financial institution want to stand behind that; then the financial transaction happens


I am an exponentially-decaying log of all my past actions
all of this, in some way, can help a financial institution make a decision on you

100% of healthcare problems are the result of scarcity of actionable data/insight


infertility is not a really big market, but it's important
many women do not know their precise fertility cycle, so more data is the solution
so by asking users to input data just through the app, they could build a data model

this is a blueprint for healthcare
more data, better predictive modeling

sensors reading data from humans will change healthcare

can gather data from 9 sensors on bicycle

right now the patient only interfaces with the doctor in that visit

why isn't there a sensor built into my toilet? smart toilets
then you get a daily feed of information, not just a twice yearly pee test

it's discouraging when someone in the medical industry says no they don't need that data

is data also a currency?
it's worth some additional privacy breach to me if I can get the best insurance coverage

sensor under baby, a cloud-component that triggers layers of alarms to save the baby's life



what about personality science?

Industries where software/data have not taken over the world: energy, *education*, healthcare, and finance



##A second-level header


>most people hate their bank
>most don't respect the institutions and crappy technology of today's banks

Affirm is starting with point-of-sales financing
so instead of buying a couch and putting it on your credit card, you get a loan from Affirm
**merchants experienced 20-30% increase in sales**
a few $100 to a few $1000 loans

"there's all kinds of great tells"
stopping people who have no intention of paying back
then there's people in between who have a certain probability of paying it back
then there's people who seem like they will definitely pay it back, but then they're unable to (for example due to a medical emergency); it's very difficult to predict this group (charging this group anything other than a minimal rate will eliminate the transaction)
but if you know about their life, how often they drive, where they walk to, their commute path, etc. then you can predict their risk a lot better
but then you can say, you'll get a 0.1% lower mortgage rate if you give your commute data


What happens when a non-government organization gets so much aggregate data that they have real power

###A third-level header

the data revolution is rolling around; the best we can do is to try to use it for good, it's not something we can stop or feel sorry for


Having tasted a little bit of success with Glow, it's hard not to try to do it with everything

you have to get users to give you data (you can't just pay them because then you get crap)
got the first algorithm from a book, then added a few rules on top of that to reduce error rate from 30% to 20%




messy, unstructured data is probably hugely undervalued, because no one has taken the time to clean it yet and see the value in it
being able to visualize that data, computer graphics, is also important

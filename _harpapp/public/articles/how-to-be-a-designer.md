How to Be a UX/Product Designer
===============================

**These are my own notes on things I've learned from experience, with some occassional quotes which I've found incisive**

###On Process

Have principles when you design – a specific set of principles you decide on for that product. You can't just trust everything to taste.

Creativity is at its best when there are limitations. Cliche but true.

DO mockup and wireframe; those are important. 

Find inspiration and ideas before working on a project (most designers do this, actually); go on Dribbble and Behance and find interesting things you could potentially build off of.

What's between a good design and a great design?
- perfect spacing and alignment
- right colors
- typography that doesn't look amateurish
- illustrations and/or imagery (this is surprisingly important)

DON'T design in code.
It's actually more efficient to do the design in high-fidelity statically (with Sketch or Photoshop) and then have someone (possibly the same person) who's really good at front-end code it up to near pixel-perfect.
Because if you're trying to design it while you're coding it, it just doesn't work and you won't have really good results.

So you should design it first. Design what you want to include and why you want to include it and how you will include it.

Nice images make things look way nice, even if they're unnecessary in the user experience

There needs to be a freeze date, at which layout and architecture info is finalized so the beautification and interface stuff can happen

I like to do the color and texture bits last because that's the fun part and it requires a finalized design and doesn't take much effort. It's the least important part for a good UX yet that's what most people notice and think you need to do first .


###On Your Role as a Designer

"UX is a system. It's everything working in concert for the benefit of the user. We need system thinking." YES

Doing contract work for a project or client just isn't great, because any project or startup needs its own design thinker who gets it, who will make sure everything turns out as well as originally planned. If it's just a contract designer he or she hands over the work but in a few iterations the product will still turn to shit.

"Behavioral science is about mind-reading — understanding how other people think and act."

"Sometimes, bosses and clients only exist to find something wrong and correct it. If you're dealing with a particularly critical person, writer Oliver Burkeman suggests adding in an intentional flaw to distract them.
The idea is that when the client looks over your work, they'll find the obvious mistake and, feeling satisfied with having made some kind of input, leave the rest of the work alone.
Heard a similar story years ago but not so flaw-oriented, necessarily. It was someone whose job it was to (IIRC) create commercials, and he referred to it as 'taking out the helicopter' - they'd do a promo for their work which would include an expensive helicopter fly-over camera shot as well, and the client would feel great about cutting back the proposed budget by suggesting they remove that item."

Always err toward the optimistic side, because whether you think you can or you can't, you're right. 

Those with a natural sense can definitely learn from everyday things and eventually be very good. But purpose of books and classes is exposure to the good and bad and analysis of why in a much faster method. 

Don't forget to wireframe first, and then when everything's good, do the high-fidelity mocks

Things like custom icons and stuff are what customers think you should do but it takes a long time and is very simple work that adds little of your value.

Don't ask the client to choose which they like better and then say you like this one better. No, if one is better then it is better.

Given the amount of effort to make it look perfect, Photoshop mocks really are obsolete. If you have the sensibility and taste, and sketch it out and do some clean wireframes, code it up, then fill in with appropriate graphics (fun part).



###On Working in a Team / Holding Meetings

Cunningham's Law states "the best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer."
"This is also a great way to solve a problem. If everyone in the room is stumped, throw out a stupid solution. If nobody can improve on it, then the last solution wins."
People generally don't like to propose imperfect solutions because of the fear of looking dumb and wasting time. But, when everyone is stumped, sitting in silence is wasting time. 
I call this "proposing a strawman solution". I don't know why it works, but it frequently does. 
You can solve many problems by picking a solution that you know is inadequate, then iterating.
It obviously doesn't get rid of the need for a better understanding of the problem.
Also, the point of a straw man proposal isn't exactly to be refined… it's to get jump off ideas from the straw man's trivial refutation.


If someone posts a brief description to a simple problem without sufficient detail, they're more likely to get engagement because the initial question will be easier to process and read, and people will follow-up asking for additional detail. When the original poster replies with the additional detail, the participants in the thread will feel a stronger sense of social obligation to answer. This iterative approach that requires mutual investment and the establishment of a social expectation before the whole question is posted may be beneficial even in highly focused, highly technical forums.


"Good design can be done over the phone."
-Konstantin Grcic
A strong idea can be communicated in words. It doesn't need drawings — it's a process of dialogue. If the idea is strong enough, it will turn into a good product. 


"If your boss thinks you're awesome, you will become more awesome"

"I really like that I’m working with designers who want to be more involved in actually shaping the product and user experience. I didn’t realize how dominant product managers were where I previously worked until I came here. Before, the product manager (myself included) would do most of the wireframing and mocking before it ever reached a designer for input."

It's not a good idea to place designers under supervision of a software guy.


Ask how bold/adventurous their overall software should be (bold new UX vs tried and true)
Ask for some inspiration apps, show them some different styles (TechCrunch, VSCO, Path)
Ask for overall style, offer to do some style tiles

Don't forget UI and graphics are only a small subset of my expertise and value

Argue my designs more, don't just show and wait for comment



###On Hands-On Work

When doing logo design, I should probably have a hi-fidelity hand sketch and just trace it on Illustrator. Don't be lazy and just try to dive into Illustrator and make something. Illustrator is horrible for creativity, rough, experimental things. The nature of working with vectors means you can get very clean, very polished results. 

Don't ALWAYS go for realistic proportions and sensibility when designing icons and graphics etc. It sometimes works better when someone has to wonder about it.

It's sort of a contradiction. For designers, UX designers and product people, focusing on the tiny graphical asset is kind of looked down upon. I mean, designers have far bigger purpose than that. Yet if you want to do a good work, each little graphic you can spent an ungodly amount of time on. And many serious artist-graphic-designers do spend a lot of time and make lots of commission money occasionally on a very small graphical asset.


###On animation and motion design

When prototyping, it just has to seem real, to allow someone understand how the interactions 

Animations are key. Sometimes people just get really caught up with making the mockups. 



###On the Technical Side

When the technology doesn't compromise the experience in terms of usability and delight, you can add the technology.

Coding up a front-end by hand is a drag. You have to worry and tweak so many things to get it just right. Outsource that to the person who made a template, and let them worry about all the fine adjustments to perfection. (this is most true when you're trying to build something rapidly and don't have the luxury of a front-end engineer)

You can use a few base HTML/CSS files that you're familiar with to start off any prototype.

"As UX designers, we often aren't the ones who obsess over page load times and how many bytes we can shave off a JavaScript usage, but that's quite important too"


###On Creating Delight

Just one custom illustration or artwork brings much warmth to a page

"To the user, the interface is the product."

Think about the uncanny valley of brand and tone and never, ever force it.



###On Creating Beauty 

When you explain the history and heritage of something, it really increases its value
Like when you sell on Craigslist, wrap a story around it

Moving things, especially things that represent outside voices, makes a page look far more lively. For example scrolling twitter mentions, or sliding press mention logos.

More room to breathe always better than less room to breathe
Line things up and give room 


###On Finding Eyeballs

People love "bonus" things

How to host a grand opening:
Tease people's curiosity by offering a mystery gift or a surprise guest
"Free" or "mystery" are always good words 
Fewer hours adds some limited-edition urgency feel
Reach out to journalists and calendars a month in advance, make marketing really distinctive 
Enlist your neighboring businesses who love to cross-promote, also gives you good relations
People show up for free food
Recruit volunteers if you must, but make sure there are enough people enforcing line and taking questions
Hold a soft opening with friends, vendors, press
Make sure guests walk off knowing future events and promotions
Produce lots of photos and videos to put on social media so people can see the business at its wildest

"Let’s be honest, lists are the dumbest smartest thing ever. They are completely subjective but people like numbers and rankings so they gravitate towards them and treat it like the gospel."

Something that looks like a notification count, or is a notification count such as a 1 in a circle somewhere makes people really want to click it

“It’s generally about optimizing interfaces for the human visual cortex,” says Fabian Stelzer, co-founder and CEO of Berlin-based startup EyeQuant, whose predictive software for tracking attention was used in the survey. If an element sticks out in comparison to other elements, there’s a higher probability of it being looked and clicked on.


###On Hiring Good Talent

“I have a simple rule,” Zuckerberg said. “I will only hire someone to work directly for me … if I would work for that person.”


###On Envy

You have to take into account the tools. Some tools will have a certain look. Something done in Illustrator can easily be identified as Illustrator. 

###On Doing Design Research

"Full-blown ethnographic studies where you visit customers face-to-face in their homes and workplaces can be cost prohibitive. However, money and time should not be barriers to gathering actionable data. This presentation will show you how to recruit, screen, and interview high-value customers. We will review how to document the data, synthesize the findings, and produce actionable recommendations; all within a very modest budget."


###On Iteration and Getting Better

Some organizations (especially non-profits) are not so good at collecting data to see if something's working 
Evidence-based policy, modesty, curiosity, willingness to collect data


"Design-based research (DBR) is used to study learning in environments which are designed and systematically changed by the researcher. The goal of DBR is to use the close study of a single learning environment, usually as it passes through multiple iterations and as it occurs in naturalistic contexts, to develop new theories, artifacts, and practices that can be generalized to other schools and classrooms. Design-based research involves the creation of a theoretically-inspired innovation, usually a learning environment, to directly address a local problem. Although showing local gains is an important element of DBR, the focus is on simultaneously developing a design and generating new theory. In other words, the design work, while addressing a local problem, should be in the service of theory generation with evidence of its effectiveness being a requisite to theory development."


"What is the best process for simplifying a user interface and experience?
Remove features. The more features you have, the more complexity you have.
Hide features. Use menus, tabs, dropdowns, etc. to make features available, but not seen until needed.
Organize features. Cluster like features, content, and controls together under a single area (which can be hidden).
Tightly align the user's mental model with the product's conceptual model. The closer you get, the simpler it will seem.
Make every choice visible. Rather than hiding all choices under a dropdown, for instance, show them all.
Conversely, hide some choices if there are too many to be reasonably scanned.
Reduce choice. Take away customization and limit choices to the most often used.
Smart defaults. Have them. Make them visible.
Shortcuts. Make shortcuts to the most used actions in the product.
Distribute functionality to the right platform. Decide where functionality should logically be located: device, desktop, web. Don't cram everything onto one platform unless it makes sense to do so."


###On Broader Concerns

Doing art isn't easy even for artists; it's a huge struggle. 

There are so many individual topics and books on such things as color design. You can't read it all. The best you can be is do good work……?

Design is artistic ideals in a non-artistic environment, meaning you have to admit there's need for economics and efficiency. You also have to be strong and convince the world around you that the artistic pursuits you do have merit. Design as compared to art also satisfies those who don't want to stop learning from the world and accumulating experience, because design is one part natural taste and many parts learning and seeing how things are done. 

Designer and artists do share the affinity and high awareness of humans' emotions 

Design is a clearer-cut form of art with more emphasis on aesthetics and positive feeling

Taste and age
=============

When you are young, your taste is least corrupt

then as you get older, your taste become the taste of other people

You see a lamp and think it's beautiful, but is it because it's actually inherently beautiful or because you have seen the lamp portrayed in contexts in which it is deemed beautiful?

What is presented as beautiful becomes what you think is beautiful.

It's no longer inherent beauty

And this is why the designs you create and record at a young age are so important.

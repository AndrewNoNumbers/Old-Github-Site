Gigaom Roadmap 2014
===================

Morning session ppl
---------------------------

John Maeda, KPCB

Matías Duarte, VP Design, Android, Google

Pivotal Labs



Afternoon session ppl
-------------------------------

###Adrian Canoso, SAVIone (3/5, slightly less structured, genuine though)
prev. Industrial Designer at Willow Garage
personal robotics startup
pretty interesting, niche commercial use though


###Brant Ward https://events.gigaom.com/roadmap-2014/speaker/j-brant-ward/ (3/5, fairly good content, but read speech and way too flat)
Voice UIs
prev. Nuance and Microsoft
UConn

If the system is apathetic, so is the user.
Why should the user care? Why should they user use it?
Humans like to build emotional connections. We want to love. 
Often we want to love the current generation of tech, but unable to do so.


Speech interface has to be
- likable
- interesting
- enduring
- conversational
- personal
these qualities can become an extension of brand
speech recognition doesn't have brand recognition, it either works or it doesn't work, but the voice does

User emotion can be drawn from:
Non-verbal cues, mood, musical themes

Sterile environments are not the real world. Sometimes flaws are good.

the box that plays ambient asian sounds is actually pretty interesting (playing ambient sound that draws the mood is quite interesting - but it has to be seriously good and perhaps algorithmic that generates with a huge amount of variety in real-time, not pre-recorded loops)


###Phillip Rosedale (2/5, very candid, too candid, not very insightful)

younger founders mostly pitch on their traction, their numbers
but older founders can pitch on their record, their expertise - they have enough expertise to be leaders in their field

we don't know the potential of virtual worlds yet, just like we didn't know the huge potential of the internet at the beginning of the internet

whether the stimulus comes into our eyes as pixels or if it's the "organic" world, it's about the way our brains perceive space

Uncanny valley - the closer the representation is to real life, the more our brains are sensitive to slight miscues in the representation - perhaps part of our survival instinct 



###Peter Skillman — Head of Design, HERE https://www.linkedin.com/pub/peter-skillman/0/499/879
Previously was Navteq and Nokia's own mapping division - now combined into HERE

152 million cars will be connected to the internet
allows you to build prediction beyond where the car can see

it's not about technology, it's about trust
people need to trust their cars

the key to trust is intent
people should know why their car is doing what it's doing - according to this guy's theory
if your guy takes some evasive action, you'll know why, if you need to turn left soon, you'll know why your car changed lanes

HERE maps builds a 3D model of the world, and combines it with our 2D maps



###Simon Rogers — Data Editor, Twitter

Twitter mostly only has the content of the tweet
doesn't have rich connections graph about you like Facebook

CartoDB can make some pretty cool visualizations
for example
World Cup games
Ice Bucket Challenge
these things are great to show over a time segment

the State of the Union address overlay that shows how people reacted to each segment of text is interesting



###Castlight Health workshop (this?)

some companies just don't know how to do design-thinking

some people are really good, natural explainers; and they are good as spokespeople

Fitbit is expanding its enterprise health incentive programs, which is interesting when you think about how a company evolves

You can still say "I", since you're not just a slave of the company, you know what you're talking about - you have a brain

Design by itself is meaningless; when we first had desktop publishing everyone would use 20 fonts per page, and that looked terrible, that didn't make them designers.



Holger Mueller - Constellation Research person
Zia Yusuf - 
Christine Evans - Fitbit / went into fashion apparel, then medical devices



design is many things
design-thinking is a useful way to think, it's a skill that people can and should learn
this is what Stanford sort of pioneered

SAP
there's a very small ratio of designers to other employees in enterprise in general






###Robert Brunner, Ammunition (4/5, good candid explanation, but also great use of video)
BFID at SJSU
prev. Industrial Design at Apple
Chief Designer of Beats

The Case of Tools, most digital tools right now are not nearly as free as traditional analog tools

Ammunition has a nice studio, but it's also about selling
Adobe Ink & Slide were made by them; pretty impressive


Leeo
amazing sensing technology
night light that had other capabilities
listens for beeps by smoke alarm and CO2 alarm, and also senses temperature and humidity changes, so that it contacts your phone, 911, your friends & neighbors if something happens

cool design solution, very niche problem
this thing is quite simple to build, I could build it

so I can also do something similar, like the alarm clock idea



Day 2 Morning
-------------



Most presenters look down at their slides, and it's helpful

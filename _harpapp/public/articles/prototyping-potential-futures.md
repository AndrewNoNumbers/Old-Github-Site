Technology heirlooms (in collaboration with Microsoft Research)

Field study in the UK

We have so many photos that we don't what's there and we won't care about them in a year
Which is why we need a physical embodiment

Photobox

Facebook received 4000 photos per second

Put Zink printer in a wooden box, which would print photos at random intervals

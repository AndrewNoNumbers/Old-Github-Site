==================


Nice thing about UX is everyone is learning


##Intuit
How to hack execs, how to make sure they're behind design
Many of execs are not designers or researchers so they don't get design, but they're not going to tell you that
Even if you just show them what good design is they won't get it
If you find the right books for the product manager and exec to read, that still won't work
Execs want you to bring energy to the room, not suck it
Is a book a gift? No, if it's not a subject you care about. Otherwise it's a burden.
Design is hard to describe

Ask exec:
Share an experience that delighted you, they start to remember what they feel and everyone else gets them and feels that empathy
Look at the cost of bad design
How do you get them to understand mobile? sent them on a scavenger hunt through Chinatown that required them to use of different innovative apps, the ones who finished first got to see the slower ones come in, there's peer experience

Second thing is, they won't tell you they don't know what to do, they don't know how to support you
If you let them know what would help they are happy to support you


Design for delight: Launching it company-wide, then having coaches to instill this in everyone: Deep customer empathy, go broad with ideas then narrow, rapid experiment with customers


They love metrics and don't want ambiguity
Showed them ratios of product managers to designers at different firms, and that showed Intuit was out of whack
Intuit quickly got 20% more designers
Behavioral economists ran experiments and showed results of delight
Delight accounts for 75% of net promoters or something like that

In sum:
Create visceral experiences because people who feel it in their hearts will want to do it
Give execs a job, because otherwise they don't know how to help





##Amazon, data helps you make decisions, PR McCormick
Amazon is well known for being data-driven in anything
Lead a team of incredibly talented UX and front-end designers
Launched modular interface elements so there are different ways to select products
6 individuals, decoupled from any other team, can design develop and deploy something and put it in front of real Amazon customers
Amazon's internal A/B testing tech, very powerful but steep learning curve

Just a simple page, bumped up thumbnail size, ran A/B test for a few weeks
Somehow the smaller illegible thumbnail performed better
The most important lesson with data: I'm not as smart as I think I am

The point of experiments isn't to show your design is right. All this quantitative data is your customers.

The site director came and asked why their bounce rate is so high compared to comparable sites
Immediately organized brainstorming and auditing sessions, but instead the good idea was to break it out by traffic channels - paid search, direct traffic, organic, affiliate ads (ah here is the issue)
Go deeper in your data, don't just react off of one before understanding it

An unsolicited redesign from Dribbble, compared to old 2004 page
the little sun icon was there because data showed that the sun icon increased conversions, the problem was it was not optimizing for the holistic experience but just little data points on the page
the dribbble design is the opposite, making the design without any context or data of Amazon
to test to optimize things, run a test when you have a hypothesis
engagement of slideshows is that the first slide is super highly interacted but the rest is not
like why would I click 4, oh dot number 3 is great. There's no reason for the customer to want to see what's back there. There was no reason for anyone to want to play with our slideshow. So there was the hypothesis and they started trying different interfaces, like the sidebar slideshow with headings that you now see. What customers see is not a slideshow, but content that they like and will interact with.

Data can't think long-term for you, it doesn't make decisions for you. So they ended up using the larger, visible product thumbnail anyway, and didn't obssess over optimization

##Paco Viñoly, Design Director, Square
Designing in a Developer World: How To Draw A Straight Line

Design & engineering and how they work together
Always ask why and continually ask why whether you're design or engineering or finance etc

Gives a talk every week at Square for new hires about design (for non-designers)
Not going to do a design presentation here

Straight lines in pixels are based on algorithms to make it look straight to the human eye

the perfect 1px line, and they play with CSS, and finally comes up with an SVG 1px line

there's no way we can drive to that perfection as designers if there aren't engineers helping us
he comes from the arts side, even the CSS is engineering

How to work:
kick off the project with everyone in the room 
methodologies are outdated (waterfall, even agile, etc.)
sit next to each other
design in code

define the audience, goals, and metrics (what the business team or research team gives you as goals are important)
understand form factors and breakpoints
design every state
defend your design



##Cap Watkins, Product Design Lead, Etsy
Designing for Scale: Etsy’s Principles of Product Design
hiring 12 more designers, hint hint

entire organization is growing really fast, 500 people almost
how does a 20-person design team scale

Prereq to design at Etsy, does full-stack work; ux, visual design, front-end code (they've got 20 people so it can't be that rare hehe)
Design-Develop-Measure
design goes all the way to the end

Designers should get involved early.
Write down problems first and the tenets/goals of that project, and send them out and people disagree on the goals and it goes around a bit until everyone is aligned to the same goal
THEN you start doing work

Design is usually the smallest team
Each designer at Etsy knows what everyone else on the team is doing (unlike in most engr teams). Need to think holistically and know how it all works together.
Don't stay in silos
(Everyone is really honest at Etsy)
we have designers who use vim

My favorite email is Basecamp email about all the work and discussion that has been posted from the day before (really good as a design manager)

Design critiques twice a week where they can see other designers' work 

Celebrate failure
It's as if design-develop-measure is a straightforward process, but actually, we're wrong a lot
Short. Iterative. Measure.

Stuff have been added over many years and it just becomes cluttered with considering holistic
Lots of interesting customer comments when the team goes to respond to customer support emails every two weeks

Released the new listing page to 1% of traffic for a few weeks. Bounce rate went way up. All the "positive actions" (add to cart, favorite, etc.) went down. So experiment failed.
We know v1's always fail. So we plan for it to fail. 

Ended up shipping 21 versions of that listing page over 6 months, each one has a codename lol.
Stopped at 6 months because that's the timeframe they gave themselves

3% conversion gain, I think he said, and when it's $1 billion in sales that's nothing to sneeze at

All principles are subject to change, because things will fail and we can evolve and improve

It's his first job managing designers




##Tyson Kallberg, Product Designer, Asana (went from agency doing mobile design, and made the jump to product)
Designing for Usability: Asana's 5 Dimensions of Prototyping Fidelity

The point of a prototype is to solve a problem a Photoshop mock can't and do it without spending a ridiculous amount of development time

Visual (sketch–pixel-perfect)
Interaction (is it just some screens that advance or are there a ton of buttons)
Breadth (is it all the use cases, all the nav)
Depth (all the edge cases, the errors screens)
Data (lorem ipsum or real data)
Full product = all of them in the full direction
think of a pentagon

Paper prototype - easy to set up but little visual fidelity
Motion - after effects, quartz composer
Click-through - invision, keynote, fireworks (lots of depth but takes a lot of time)

New font prototype: wanted to see what a new font change looks like on different sizes and devices

infographics, they display tabular data in a prettier way but don't give any more context

using quartz composer to starting sketching data as the hockey game goes and that graph shows how the game is going, hockey fans can know right away what game the graph was showing

quartz has reputation of being hard to use but easier than programming
flinto, phlinto?
click-thru prototypes are fantastic for user research
aftereffects, even keynote, can be good showing animation effects quickly

prototypes for stakeholder buy-in, click-thrus and phlinto types are good or a movie showing all the use cases





##Björn Jeffery, CEO & Co-Founder, Toca Boca
Designing for Differentiation: How to Strategically Position Your Brand in a Crowded Space  
CEO, he does what designers want him to do so the business operates well

Digital toy as opposed to a game (there's no win or lose, there's no stress or timers, the fun comes from exploration and building things)

They needed something that's a bit more discoverable in the App Store context
They need something you can search for, and that's the brand
Picked out some of the brands they liked from the field of toymakers and game companies
Something that looked in digital contexts, for example Facebook where they'll engage a lot with parents
When you hear it, kids come running (like Pixar intro, or Bolibompa jingle) It's a brand but it's memorable for kids.
A "sound logo"
The wSimpsons intro, always differs a little. Makes it a valuable thing for you want enjoy and watch it.
It ties together the different apps with one brand, and the sound design was very intentionally designed 

21 different designers, about 15 of which are product Dedigner,21 different designers, about 15 of which are product designerss

A ton of paperwork in adopting a child

Bridging physical to digital is not a good process





##Beverly Freeman, Lead User Experience Researcher, eBay Inc.
eBay 
Two UX approaches to best the competition

Product-centric
Who you compete with

Control for brand halo/baggage effects
Compare before and after use of how likely someone wants to use something again
Then you separate whether the effect is love of the brand or the experience 
That's how you know whether you want to invest in the experience or whether want to invest in the marketing 


Or experience-centric
What you compete with

Real life environmental effects
What are the factors that prevent people from going to store, buying?
Like parking, that's an upstream issue 
For customers the experience isn't over til they accomplished their goal, so getting furniture home and integrating into their home. If they want 

You can learn from analogous experiences, such as Disneyland even though it's a totally different domain. Both of crowds and lots of kids and people.

By winning on these upstream and downstream issues, you actually open up market to customers that your competitors can't get. 

People don't use you because you're a software company, they use you because they want to do something






##Frank Yoo, Mobile Product Lead, Lyft
Designing for a Peer-to-Peer Marketplace: The Influence of Supply and Demand in Lyft's Mobile Design
hiring everyone

18 cities & growing
Just passed 1 million rides

Stories, heartwarming stories
In peer-to-peer, got drivers (supply) until reaching critical mass in SF
So Zimride actually launched Lyft, and it was sort of an experiment at first that used pre-vetted Zimride drivers

With airbnb, great guests make great hosts
the community aspect encourages good feeling
So Lyft put both driver and rider interfaces into one app, because then it looks like they're just someone using the app too, though each still optimized (especially driver interface with arm-away interface and sound cues)

After they got the supply in place, they spread the word and because it's SF it just spread super quickly
But how do you reach equilibrium for supply and demand?

Throttling demand - keep power users happy, get newbies excited (newbies don't know what they're missing since they're kept out), and recruit drivers

Having the two interfaces in one app also makes it a super attractive a smooth experience to attract riders to become drivers, and even try out the interface
It makes it easy for users to envision themselves offering the same thing to others

The Lyft community meeting really shows the city needs and wants them
people feel safe, makes city feel like community, how diverse the city is




##@Berkun

"the data says" no the data doesn't say anything. Also can't only have a growth hacker or product person knowing the data.
How to lie with statistics. Book

it'll be worth the price of admission to be here to scan through Wikipedia's list of cognitive biases






##500 Startups batch 007
They should be at office and not here haha
Intern doing the interview of speakers
Really quite bad at hosting or speaking or making good-looking things
I find 500's choices of startups a bit questionable.
says they really care about design and want to keep investing in designers
the design award they have




CommitChange
Simplified the donation page
they can take an untrained intern rather than having to go to an expensive conference just to learn how to use something




##Google Ventures 
Build for Speed: How to Prototype and Test Any Product in Five Days
Daniel Burka, Design Partner, Google Ventures
Jake Knapp, Design Partner, Google Ventures

Nintendo, 9 years old, everyone relates
make audience laugh, have a colorful story that feels personal

Hypothesis-build-launch-inconclusive results
now product's out in the wild, and what do you do, you can't remove it now, so how can you iterate?

So Google Ventures is doing only a prototyping process rather than full lean
5-day design sprint

To put a deadline, on Monday schedule 5 testers who will come in on Friday morning 9am
the deadline that you can't get out of is important

No group brainstorming, you get groupthink and coming up with ideas that aren't well thought-through
Go alone and sketch some interfaces
Voting is better than talking
Everyone votes, then the design decision-maker gets weighted votes
They use Keynote a lot beyond paper mocks, it lets you have a middle level of fidelity without worrying about typography and lines and gradients etc. They use Keynotopia

Small companies are scared of doing user research because it sounds complex
just found testers on Craigslist

2x time on site and 2x sales


a lot of text turns out to give legitimacy to the coffee company, conveys confidence, even if no one reads the story of the company 


You can take the word ship out of it. Learn early, learn often. "rent before you buy"

Written extensively on GV library






##Jeffrey Veen, Vice President of Products, Adobe Creative Cloud
Designing with Momentum: When To Go Fast, When To Go Slow

Has been making webpages for 20 years, it seems like design finally won, people agree that design is needed

safety, camaraderie, trust in environment. that's what makes a creative environment.


Design is no longer a competitive advantage so what's next? The culture of the team building products

slack, the group collaboration too;

Design review shouldn't be where designer launches the beautiful thing out there and everyone fires on it

Product Review meeting:
optional attendance, mandatory participation (ah)
not a forum for expressing opinions (you can't say, I don't like that blue. Say, why is that blue? Better: Is color important here?)
Define what time of meeting it is: divergent thinking or convergent thinking 
Let the whole team have better design instincts, give everyone design vocabulary, share great designs


The postmortem meeting:

Ask Why 5x, discover the root cause

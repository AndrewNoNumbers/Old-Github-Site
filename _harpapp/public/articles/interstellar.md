Family-owned theatre

35mm film, though flickering 

Really good effect

Murphy's law 

Drones, indian 

**There are no more armies**

**Edu is still unsolved**

**World needs more food**

**Space is euthanized, liberal agenda of staying on earth**

A few well-placed brands. Dell, Ram, inconsistent tho 

Science

**2-way radio communication because there is no infrastructure anymore**

**Food security vs NASA funding**

Dr. Brand

**Daughter's generation and climate change**

Reconciles ecology and space exploration and faith?

**Moving humans or just transporting their eggs**


Barely any CGI effects, which is good

90% honesty setting for AI  
for effective communications 

"You don't think nature can be evil"


*Film is really an art  
And like all art can have profound impact more than most other forms of communication *

**Time as a resource**  
Relativity  
Every bit oxygen and food goes down

*Perfect pace, keeps engaged  
A host of actors  
TARS will be a good timeless icon*

Pilot still matters  
Different subject area experts


**What is time**

**What is love**


Plan B will start a colony and prevent us from extinction

Explorers will be in cryogenic sleep until next expedition may be able to rescue


We care about those we know, but not about our species

*Interestingly I didn't like Inception much  
Too complex and heavy-handed*

*Ambitious is right*






>Interstellar is probably one of the greatest films I've seen in years. It leave you emotionally shattered at the end of it, pushing all the right buttons relentlessly for nearly 3 hours - tears, funny, tension (some really tense moments), and then towards the end, pushing the intelligence of the audience to the very edge, beyond what we know, to what may be possible.

>The movie was grand in scale as well as in attention to detail. It stayed cohesive even as it spread out to mind numbing extension and expansion and yet somehow it managed to retain a connection with the raw human emotions that we all share through the fact of our existence. The ending was as thought provoking as it was emotionally explosive-a true masterpiece and one of the best films i've seen in years. Do not be swayed by small minds.





>Really, because I read this review and wondered if The New Republic had become some idiocy-spewing conservative garbage. 

>What's remarkable is that the film can be interpreted both ways, and so any criticism at the film can also be interpreted in either political direction.

Jeff Queisser and Sam Ghods, 2 of 4 co-founders of Box
==============================================

A bit of history
-------------------

4 co-founders 

All went to high school together  
went to different colleges  
got together at Berkeley, raised some funding  

hadn't had any real world jobs at the time


Two co-founders were on the tech side
was in meetings all day, even as VP of Engineering  
made the hard decision to give up role and go back to focusing on engineering

In a startup, there's tech ops, and there's engineering


spending a year at a real company is really valuable

dropped out sophomore year


On managing
------------------

at some point the company becomes a certain size and the work becomes a little more abstracted and you don't exactly have insight into what every individual contributor is doing  
you just hire amazing people and trust them to execute

Within engineering: individual contributors and management each has its own ladder, and should go up in compensation equally in a good organization



How to become a more attractive engineering candidate
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

read HN everyday to learn things  
you'll learn a shit ton

Github is amazing for watching sw engineers do their work  
all the most amazing software projects are on Github, and you can contribute very easily

if you're a contributor on 10 OSS projects, that's terrific

do hobby projects



On building Box
-----------------------

Sam  
did 2 startups before

Jeff  
hadn't done any startups, had a computer consulting business

had an initial angel investor in Seattle

What's good about enterprise  
They have a lot of users, they have the money, and they have problems to solve

What makes enterprise different  
CIO has requirements and they need to make sure a tool they use satisfies all that and they need to make sure all 300,000 people in their organization can use this tool effectively

there was a very consumer-focused phase, then focused on enterprise and that was became the revenue source

---

working on this idea all came down to the team  
wasn't very optimistic because they couldn't really figure out a business model

that's the right way to make a decision all the time, work on something with a group of people you know you'll have fun with

you should have a broad thesis on the area, but exact implementation can change

It's a "once-in-a-generation" paradigm shift  
mainframes -> client-server -> cloud

Box wants to get users now, and that's what they're investing in and not turning a profit

---

Aaron got 40,000 sign-ups just by blog marketing  
was really powerful

sort of pioneered the freemium model  
didn't have a revenue model for the first 3 years


4 people  
vision (that was Aaron), finance, tech, servers


Are we in a tech bubble?  
A lot of the companies, like Facebook, like Uber create real value and either dominate a market or generate real, meaningful revenue

Envisioning the Future of Detroit
==================================


###Jennifer Granholm
Distinguished Adjunct Professor, UC Berkeley School of Law & Goldman School of Public Policy


Really enthusiastic speaker


$18 billion budget hole, had to file bankruptcy 
this followed bankruptcy in auto industry

poster child of de-industrialization of America


hundreds of companies announce mass layoffs; unemployment goes way up
revenue is way down for state government
has to slash budgets
put public schools on emergency declaration

90% decline in manufacturing jobs from 50's to now
white flight
the city of Detroit is 10% white, avg. per capita income of $14,000, 114000 vacant parcels

people are out of work, and scared
(why, because we depend on capitalistic system to survive)




###Toni L. Griffin (visiting professor, Founder of an organization)  (really interesting speaker)

Foundation called her up to discuss a land use problem they wanted to think about
Want her to help with the land use aspect

Learning from Detroit

city fabric begins to corrode because people are migrating out and leaving holes
massive amounts of population loss

Transit-oriented development (TOD)?
Villages?

140 sq mi.

Revitalizing more than just the downtown because employment was clustered in different districts

Will not return to former density and form, so we must create new urban typologies for neighborhoods that stabilize

many people own their properties (so we can't just uproot them)
lots of land is single-family homes

Live+Make neighborhood
(perhaps I should collaborate with a few urban planners working in actual cities)

Every area of the city needs to be invested in, but perhaps no in the same ways it was before - alternative use
Future Open Space Networks (just open green land that cleans water and cleans air)
align with 21st century demographics and infrastructure systems (multi-use - bikes, cars, etc.)




###Michelle Wilde Anderson (really interesting speaker) BA in History at Yale
Professor of Law, Stanford Law School

subpar speaker, but still strong

What causes city insolvency?
- Economic stress (vs. financial stress) - deeper issues that simple financing won't help
- household poverty - tax revenues fall, crime and services demand go up, intergenerational poverty
- Falling population - low property values/property tax revenue, underutilized infrastructure, pension overhang (new taxpayer population is smaller)

Subprime lending -> foreclosure crisis -> tanking property values -> and then cities couldn't generate as much tax revenue

Legacy expenses and debt service on general obligation bond and COPs/swaps are rising vs. revenue, leaving little expense for current services to residents

Bankruptcy gets you a debt reduction and a new schedule to pay your debts
All bankruptcy can do is relieve your financial situation a little 

Healthcare benefits were eliminated for pensioners, mostly due to Affordable Care Act and the public exchanges
Avg pensions were fairly low, $30,000 a year for police/firefighers, $19,000 a year for non-badge

You can't liquidate a city in a bankruptcy, but you can liquidate some of the things a city owns (a museum, downtown parcels, parking garages, tunnel revenue) - usually either to non-profit entities or to suburban governance

Many poor cities no longer have public libraries, parks & rec, it's the face of poverty
It's the public sector's work on social mobility
You need a serious public sector committed to social mobility

doesn't matter if the government gives grants to a non-profit to run something



how do you give away this land for free to people who can do something 
how do you partner with the community college next door to prepare people 
will pay for two years of community college if you agree to be trained in a job skill that's in-demand



a bit of strength and energy is good to capture and engage the audience
but still be natural, not mechanical
either very casual, or very strong






needed people who were trusted in their own right to be along with their project, local firms who are there to speak
otherwise people don't trust of outsiders coming in


auctions where you can buy parcels, buy houses quite cheaply
get the help of local high-up people who want to support this

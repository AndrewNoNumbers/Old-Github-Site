Ford CFO at Engineers' Week
=============================

Bob Shanks


For every job an automaker puts in, there are 10 jobs that are created as a direct result of that (in suppliers, dealers, etc.)

For a big corporation like Ford that does business in many countries, all the little geopolitical issues matter
Consumer wants are changing

Disruption is quite clearly knocking at our doors

Ford has grown from 1 million units a year in China to 20+ million a year



Disruption:
- potentially new OEMs (Apple?, Google?) - barriers to entry in this industry are lower than they were
- autonomous vehicles and connectivity
- customer experience (like Tesla completely changes the customer experience, resulting in huge customer satisfaction rate)
- carsharing
- cities that restrict car sales

Mine:
What a vehicle/car is
Ownership

"So disruptive we can't even begin to think of what it means"
"very frightening, but that's not how we think about it"
"what's part of our business, what's part of another's business"

Consumer experience is something Ford wants to lead in
They really admire Tesla, not even so much for their product, but for their customer experience

Trying to bring Lincoln into China, starting this past November, focusing on a good customer experience

Mobility:
how people use their cars, how cars fit into their lives, how it fits into the overall transportation ecosystem - how Ford fits into that


Has acknowledged climate change is happening, and sustainability report guides the company in doing a part 

Asia-Pacific is one of their reporting regions


Did a major restructuring of business leading up to 2005, because business was very broken
Had to basically reinvent the business
Did it actually just in time before the economic downturn

Vision:
People working together as a lean global enterprise
Wants to be more balanced in where they make their money, since SUVs and trucks creates a lot of their profit right now
Wants to target operating margins of around 8-9% (Toyota, Hyundai/Kia, VW are the only other companies that can achieve these right now)


Just opened new innovation center in Palo Alto (ramping up from current 25 people to 120 people)

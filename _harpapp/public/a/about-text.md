##Hi, I'm Andrew.
I'm a student interested in design, products, behavior, and humans.

I currently live in California, but have previously inhabited places including Chicago, Florida, New York, Vancouver, Montreal, and Beijing.

I will write a longer description here later.


###About this site
This site was previously run on Weebly (2008-2009) and self-hosted Wordpress (2010-2013).

The current site was made with some HTML5, LESS, Jade, and Harp.js (which is excellent and I highly recommend to everyone). I'm not a developer but I can write some code.

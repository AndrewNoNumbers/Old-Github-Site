##Hi, I'm Andrew.
I'm a student with a strong interest in designing digital products and experiences. In the past, I've . However, what I truly love is experiences, products, behavior, and humans. 

I'm a student interested in the intersection of education and design. 

I currently live in California, but have previously inhabited places including Chicago, Florida, New York, Montreal, Beijing, and Vancouver.


###About this site
This site was made with some HTML5, LESS, Jade, Harp.js (which is excellent and I highly recommend to everyone), and Markdown. I'm not a developer but I can write some code.

This site has previously been run in Wordpress (2010-2013) and Weebly (2008-2009)

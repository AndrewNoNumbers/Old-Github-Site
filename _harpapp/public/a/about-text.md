##Hi, I'm Andrew.
I'm a UX/Product Designer with an interest in many other topics.


For more information, you can see [my resume here](/weeResume/ "weeResume").


###About this site
I made this site with Harp.js, HTML5, LESS, Jade templating and Markdown for content. I'm not a developer but I can code and I have a pretty solid background in technology.

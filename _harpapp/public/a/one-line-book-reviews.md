Practical and accessibly written with rich anecdotes but some technical inaccuracies. The "10 ways" list at the end of each chapter is helpful.

100 colorful case studies with questionable taste and usefulness.

###Seductive interaction design creating playful, fun, and effective user experiences by Stephen P. Anderson. 

###Information Architecture: Blueprint for the Web by Christina Wodtke and Austin Govella
Convoluted advice on information architecture.

###The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman
Either you've already read it or you've been meaning to read it.

###The HTML Pocket Guide by Bruce Hyslop
Very useful alternative to reading the dry HTML5 spec, with detailed discussions of semantics and how things came to be.

###Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug
Fun introduction to thinking about usability.

        Built at a hackathon sponsored by Volkswagen, IDEO, and MIT Media Lab. Working with a CS friend, we created a tool that predicts the funness of roads by various data fields collected by on-board diagnostics. We presented to a panel of judges, including the head of global marketing at VW Group. We won the GitHub Judge's Choice award.

        Built at a hackathon sponsored by Volkswagen, IDEO, and MIT Media Lab. Working with Shawn Jain, we built a tool that predicts the funness of roads by various data fields collected by a car's on-board diagnostics. We presented to a panel of judges, including the head of global marketing at VW Group.
      h4 How it works
      p.
        The tool pulls in four data fields from VW's OBD-II dataset and calculates it using our funness model, generating an approximate funness rating for each segment of road which, when combined with smartphone GPS data, can be mapped with the Google Maps API.

      p.
        I helped plan the user flow and led the design and coding of the website. We won 3rd place and a $500 prize at the Lincoln Labs hackathon in Oct 2013.
      h4 How it works
      p.
        SwapBot increases clothing donations by creating a better experience for both sides of the system: donors and recipients. We match donors' items to those with a specific need for that item and encourage communications through our platform.

      p.
        I led a complete redesign of Hejia's mobile ERP client, working with iOS and Android developers to implement on both platforms.
      h4 How it works
      p.
        Hejia is one of the leading ERP companies in China, providing small and medium-sized businesses with software to manage their businesses. The recent proliferation of mobile devices has created a demand for mobile access to ERP and information capture on the go.

        I helped plan the experience and ergonomics and assisted with soldering. Our team won 1st place of 13 teams at Science Hack Day Chicago.
      h4 How it works
      p.
        ArmAlarm is a prototype wrist-worn alarm clock that reads the wearer's heartrate using IR. It gently vibrates at a set time in the morning but can only be turned off by raising one's heartrate&mdash;meaning you have to get out of bed and do something physical!

        This is a demo of something I built way back at my first ever hackathon, when I was in high school. 
      h4 How it works
      p.
        The iOS app pulls in data from feeds made available by Carnegie Mellon University and displays them in a unified app, creating a fast experience for prospective students to engage with the school, learn about what's happening, and plan a visit.
